## Pointers

Q 1. Design and implement C program to demonstrate advantages/usage of pointers. (E.g. add two Matrices using pointer concept, Functions for string manipulation, String manipulation functions).

- Matrix multiplication

    Multiplying matrix - [https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/examples/matrix-multiplication](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/examples/matrix-multiplication)

    Mathematical way - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2spTnAiQg4M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2spTnAiQg4M)

- String manipulation

Q 2. Design and implement a database application in C. (E.g. Student/Faculty information using structures).

- Array of structures implementation
- Linked list implementation

## Stacks

Q 3. Design and implement a stack (Array implementation/ Linked list implementation) and demonstrate its working with necessary inputs. Display the appropriate messages in case of exceptions

- Array implementation
- Linked list implementation

Q 4. Design and implement an algorithm for conversion of an expression from one form to another. Demonstrate its working with suitable inputs.

- Infix to postfix conversion

    [Infix to Postfix | Expression evaluation | Appliedcourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUC2Rffejj8)

- Infix to prefix conversion

## Linked lists

Q. Design and implement a dynamic list (Singly linked list/ doubly linked list) to store any
information which needs a linear data structure.
